    <div id='542020' style="display: none;"><p>I love to bake almost as much as I love to code. There's some intersecting problem domains. I should clarify too; following a recipe and getting a consistent result is definitely the most pragmatic way to cook, but for the new chef, like myself, there's a certain thrill to 'understanding' how raw ingrediants interact, and why they're so commonly used. Sort of like learning a standard library for a language.</p>
        <p>Naturally, my first endeavor was going to be baking my favorite recipe; Meringues. They're so delightfully crisp, and the way they fall apart in your mouth like cotton candy is so pleasant. However, some very cursory research had me pretty intimidated. When you search the web for 'Meringue' or 'Mergingue Cookie Recipe', yes, you get plenty of them. But you get just as many 'Tricks for the perfect meringue' and 'never-fail meringues' results as well. For a cookie with 2 ingrediants, apparently a lot can go wrong.</p>
        <p>Attempt number 1. Two egg whites, 'scant' half-cup of sugar. Couple drips of lemon juice. Whisk on kitchen-aid, and mixer speed <b>full-boar</b>. According to my favorite youtube personality, Chef John, we whip up those eggs until they're at the 'Beer Head' stage, then slowly add sugar. Okay, easy enough. Then into a 225 degree oven for 1 hour, turn off the oven and let cool for an hour and voila! Perfect!</p>
    <p>Except totally not.</p>
    <p>Luckily, meringues are delicious even when you fuck them up.</p>
    <p>About halfway through cooling, I noticed that my cookies started to crack. They shriveled up and turned into small white turd piles. Normally mergingues should have thousands of tiny bubbles suspended in a very dry cookie, that gives them that signature fragile feel. But when I bit into mine? They were like marshmellow fluff? I don't really understand what went wrong.</p>
        <p>So, back to the drawing board. Time to figure out where I went wrong, and what adjustments I need to make in my next attempt.</p>
